2 - He is also famous for creating Linux.
3 - Git was invented in 2005.
4 - The git command to initialize a new repository is 'git init'
5 - The command 'git push' uploads any changes from the local repository (your working computer) 
    to the remote repository,
    to GitHub.
6 - A .gitignore file is used to protect your personal information from being uploaded to the git 
    repository, which souldn't be online for others to access.
    This .gitignore file also prevents uploading huge files to the internet (such as node_modules).
7 - A fork is a 'copy' of a git repository that is copied into your own personal GitHub page.
    This fork allows you to change/edit/play with code without altering the original content.
8 - A clone is a copy of a repository, usually the one on the local computer, placing it in a new directory.
    You can clone a repository as many times as you want, but I'm not sure how multiple clones would 
    be useful, as changes would not be consistent across all clones.
9 - You should NOT put a Github repo inside another GitHub repo.
10 - True, if you type git status into an uninitialized repo, then you will get an error.
